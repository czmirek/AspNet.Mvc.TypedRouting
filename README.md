# Strongly typed routing for ASP.NET Core 5.0

This project is a fork of the [AspNet.Mvc.TypedRouting](https://github.com/ivaylokenov/AspNet.Mvc.TypedRouting) (which has been dead for years) updated to .NET Core 5.0 and with some little improvements and it's published in a separate nuget. Contributions are welcome.
